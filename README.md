# POR1
Feedback i got from the cross course (Rainydays):
The checkout.js redirects to "checkout-success.html" but your actual page is named "Checkout-succes.html"
There are some unnecessary console.log statements that could be removed
The cart storage approach could be more efficient by storing more product details in the cart rather than fetching them again when displaying the cart

Changes i made based on these feedback was:
i removed thebconsole.log statement. 
I fixed the redirection so that i works on checkout.js
i persnollay liked the cart section the way i solved it in the first place so i have decided not to changes it.
