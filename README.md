Feedback i got from the cross course (Rainydays):
The checkout.js redirects to "checkout-success.html" but your actual page is named "Checkout-succes.html"
There are some unnecessary console.log statements that could be removed
The cart storage approach could be more efficient by storing more product details in the cart rather than fetching them again when displaying the cart

Changes i made based on these feedback was:
i removed thebconsole.log statement. 
I fixed the redirection so that i works on checkout.js
i persnollay liked the cart section the way i solved it in the first place so i have decided not to changes it.

Feeback from the Semester Project (community sience museum):
The hamburger menu is not ideal for large screens where ample space is available. Use a traditional navigation bar for larger screens, while retaining the hamburger menu for smaller screens.
Clicking the hamburger icon should not reload the page. Ensure smooth functionality for better user experience.

Changes i have made based on these feedback was:
I have change the HTML and CSS to have a new navigation menu that does not have an hamburger menu on bigger screens. Only on small screens. 
i have used JS to change from nav menu to hamburger menu on smaller screens. 
i have also changes so that the page does not realode when clicking the hamburger menu.
